## Project Description:
- In this Project, a small Questionnaire was developed, a Front-End Project, using only HTML for its development. On the Page we have some questions and answers,
already pre - defined in code. Each question already has a pre-defined answer that is correct in code, when we mark a wrong answer, the system shows us a red error line,
and shows a green line, identifying the correct answer, and when we mark the correct answer, the system identifies and shows us the green line informing that the selected answer is correct.

- The project has the functionality of showing a configured questionnaire, with Questions and Answers already defined in code, to show the mistakes and successes, of those who use it, a simple but functional screen
for purpose developed Front-End.

- Below we have a short instructional video, where we show an example of how the Question and Answer Game Quiz page works.
